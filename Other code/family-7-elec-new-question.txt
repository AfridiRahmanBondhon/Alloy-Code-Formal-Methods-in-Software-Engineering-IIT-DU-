Design a Dynamic Family System Model

Objective: Create a model using a modeling language to simulate dynamic family relationships and life events over time.

Requirements:

    Time Representation: Define a structure to track different time points for changes in family structure and individual statuses.

    Person Attributes: Develop an abstract type for individuals that includes:
        Variable sets of children, spouses, and parents tied to different times.
        A state indicating whether the individual is alive, which changes over time.

    Relationship Definitions: Model the dynamic relationships among parents, children, and spouses. Include functions for identifying living individuals, siblings, and blood relatives.

    Event Handling: Specify operations for marriages, births, and deaths, detailing preconditions, effects on relationships and statuses, and post-event adjustments.

    Initial Conditions: Set clear starting conditions for individuals and their relationships to ensure a valid simulation start.

    Simulation Trace: Implement a trace of the system's evolution, showing changes in relationships and statuses due to key events.

    System Validation: Use predicates to ensure:
        No individual can be their own ancestor.
        Marriages do not occur if individuals are already married or are blood relatives.
        Births only occur between married, living couples.
        Changes in life status (unborn, alive, dead) follow logical sequences.

    Advanced Constraints: Verify no individual has more than one mother or father, only living individuals can marry or have children, marriages are symmetric, and siblings cannot marry.

Model Testing:

    Run simulations to validate marriages, births, and the logical progression of life events, ensuring compliance with established rules.

Additional Considerations:

    Include provisions for handling rare scenarios like resurrection or ancestry recording errors, maintaining model integrity.
