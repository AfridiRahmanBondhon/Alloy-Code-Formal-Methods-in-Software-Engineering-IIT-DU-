Design a model representing a family tree with the following requirements using a modeling language of your choice:

    Define an abstract type for a person that includes fields for a spouse and parents.
    Create subtypes for men and women.
    Include unique instances for the first man and woman.
    Define facts to ensure:
        Each person has one mother and one father.
        No person can be their own ancestor.
        Spousal relationships are symmetric.
        A person cannot be married to their sibling.
    Include a specific relationship for the first man and woman, ensuring:
        They are married to each other.
        They have no parents.
        All other people have exactly two parents.
    Write assertions to verify:
        A person cannot marry themselves.
        Spouses must be of different genders.
    Check the assertions to ensure they hold true within the model.
