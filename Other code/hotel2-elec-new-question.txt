Design a Dynamic Hotel Management System

Objective: Develop a model using a modeling language to simulate the dynamic interactions within a hotel management system. Your model should effectively handle the relationships between rooms, guests, and the front desk, specifically focusing on the allocation and management of room keys over time.

Requirements:

    Key and Room Management:
        Model Keys and Rooms where each room has a set of keys and one current key that changes over time.
        Implement the tracking of each key to ensure it belongs to only one room at any given time.

    Guest Interactions:
        Define Guests with attributes to hold keys over different periods.
        Manage guest interactions such as checking into a room, leaving a room, and accessing a room using a key.

    Front Desk Operations:
        Create a Front Desk entity responsible for tracking the last key issued for each room and the current occupant of each room.
        Simulate the processes of check-in and check-out, updating the room's current key and occupant status accordingly.

    Event Handling:
        Specify operations for guests checking into rooms, checking out, and entering rooms. These operations should detail:
            Preconditions necessary for each event (e.g., a guest must have the correct key to enter).
            Effects on room and guest statuses as a result of the event.

    Initial Conditions:
        Establish initial conditions that no guests have keys and no rooms are occupied, ensuring a valid starting point for the system.

    System Evolution Trace:
        Implement a trace of system operations over time, showing how key allocations and room occupancies evolve through guest interactions and front desk operations.

    Validation:
        Use predicates to ensure the system adheres to logical rules such as:
            No guest can enter a room without holding the correct current key.
            A roomâ€™s last key and its current key at the front desk must always match.

Model Testing:

    Run simulations to validate key management, room assignments, and the integrity of guest interactions under various scenarios, ensuring the model behaves as expected.
